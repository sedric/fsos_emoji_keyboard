# SailfishOS Full Emoji Keymap
Based on the patch by [ichthyosaurus](https://github.com/ichthyosaurus/sailfish-public-patch-sources).

As Patchmanager 3.0 does not work with SFOS 4.0 and patch support is experimental for now, I prefered to use ichthyosaurus work to make an alternative keymap, not modifying any Sailish file (so: no emoji suggestion).

I did not modify anything to their work, just extracting files from the diff and prepare another layout, marked "Emoji(F)" in Sailfish layout configuration.

To use it, enable dev mode and copy files by yourself, a lipstick restart might be needed.

You will also need to install some emoji pack : https://gitlab.com/whisperfish/whisperfish-wiki/-/blob/master/Emojis.md

Tested on SailfishOS Kvarken (4.1.0.24) to Vanha Rauma (4.4.0.68) on Xperia XA2+.
